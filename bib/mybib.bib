abstract = {It is with great pleasure that we welcome you all to the 2019 edition of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS). CCS is the flagship annual conference of ACM's Special Interest Group on Security, Audit and Control (SIGSAC), which has been bringing together world-leading academic researchers and practitioners interested in computer security at large since 1993. As in previous years, CCS 2019 features an outstanding program of thoughtprovoking and cutting-edge research papers. In addition, a record number of 18 workshops provide a forum for in-depth discussions of established and emerging research topics alike.London is one of the most vibrant metropolises in the world and has something to offer for everyone, whether you are a first-time visitor or a long-time resident. Did you know that London boasts four World Heritage Sites? The Tower of London; Kew Gardens; Westminster Abbey and its surroundings; and the historic settlement in Greenwich. But there is much more! A wide range of world-class museums, most of which are free to visit, restaurants catering to any palate, with cuisines from every corner of the planet, countless cozy pubs and trendy bars, theatres, musicals, and over 20 major universities and about 400,000 students.CCS would not be possible without you, the community, and the many volunteers working tirelessly to make an event of this scale happen. We would like to thank the authors, who submitted their best work to this conference; the program chairs and the program committee for putting together an excellent program; the steering committee and SIGSAC for providing behind-the-scenes support; and of course the organizing committee who spent many hours on administrative and organizational tasks. Finally, we thank the numerous sponsors of the conference for their generous support.},
